\caption*{\textit{Note}: Table displays the most distinctive words by TF-IDF score in the full texts of patents associated with a given occupation. Occupations are standardized using a series of rules: we drop plural mentions of
occupations, and group together common abbreviations for `gentleman' and `esquire'. We then take the modal
occupation of inventors (or if there does not exist a mode for a particular inventor, we assign a random
occupation). TF-IDF scores are calculated using the \texttt{scikit-learn} TfidfVectorizer with the maximum number of features limited to 1,000. We restrict to words that are at least 3 letters in length, appear in at least 5 patents, and appear in at most 70\% of patents.}
